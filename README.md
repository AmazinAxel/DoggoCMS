# DoggoCMS
This is a simple CMS designed for a static site. You can easily upload these 2 files to a directory in your server, like /DoggoCMS/ and then access it easily.
## Please note that this project is using an extreme version of doggo lingo and is extremely hard to read. Use this at your own risk.
### The rest of this README file is left in doggo lingo.
